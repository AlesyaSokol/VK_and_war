FIRST PART OF THE RESEARCH - VK USERS STATISTICS

dataset.zip contains 2 csv files:

- total_users_hashed.csv - users data without info about subscribtions
- total_users_with_subscribtions_hashed.csv - users data with info about subscribtions

In both of them, the hash function was applied to users id, to make the data anonimous
