dataset.zip contains 2 csv files:

- total_users_hashed.csv - users data without info about subscribtions
- total_users_with_subscribtions_hashed.csv - users data with info about subscribtions

In both of them, the hash function was applied to users id, so the identity of the user cannot be identified

Statistics_1.ipynb is statistics about demographics and values

Subscriptions analysis_1.ipynb contains the code for plots about subscribtions analysis and ML-model
