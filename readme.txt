dataset.zip contains 2 csv files:

- total_users_hashed.csv - users data without info about subscribtions
- total_users_with_subscribtions_hashed.csv - users data with info about subscribtions

In both of them, the hash function was applied to users id, to make the data anonimous

Statistics_1.ipynb is for plots about demographics and values

Subscriptions analysis_1.ipynb contains the code for plots about subscribtions and ML-model
